# Versionizer
## About
Versionizer is a tool for automatically generating unit tests for functions that change between two commits. This
project was created under the guidance of Dr. Na Meng as part of Virginia Tech's CS 6704 Advanced Topics in 
Software Engineering Research. 

## Use
Versionizer runs as a commandline application. 

[comment]: <> (TODO run this on an actual application and update instructions here)

## Future Features
* Upload to PyPI to be used as an installable tool which can be easily integrated into existing projects.
* No longer just a CLI - Versionizer will have a main class and API to programmatic invocation.
* Between Commit function diffing will be moved to another project and also be on PyPI.
* CI/CD to assert no breaking changes get into master.
